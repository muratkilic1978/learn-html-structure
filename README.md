# learn-html-structure

This is a short introduction to the **HTML5 structure** and some basic HTML Tags for **beginners**. I recommend that you create a new index.html file with your editor eg. _Sublime_, _Atom Brackets_ or _Visual Studio Code_. I suggest that your insert All the HTML Tags from this introduction into your own **index.html** document and finally open the **index.html** in your browser eg. Mozilla FireFox or Chrome to check the result.

## The HTML `<head>` Element

The `<head>` tag primarily contains header information about the document, such as its title, keywords, description, and style sheet

### Examples

`<meta charset="UFT-8">`
**Define the character set used**

`<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Tags, structure, block-elements, inline-elements">`
**Define keywords for search engines:**

`<meta name="author" content="John Doe">`
**Define the author of a page**

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
**Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices**

## Here is an overview of the most popular HTML5 tags from WebsiteSetup.org
